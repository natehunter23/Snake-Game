# Snake Game (COE2SH4 Project)  
## Overview:  
This Snake Game project was developed as a final project for my COE2SH4 course, it is an implementation of the classic snake game using C++ Object-Oriented Design (OOD) principles. The game provides a classic gaming experience with a focus on clean code structure and extensibility.

## Key Features  
- Classic Mode Gameplay:  
  - Randomly generated snake food and initial snake head placement.  
  - Four-directional movement with boundary wrapping.  
  - Incremental scoring system based on collected food.  
- Object-Oriented Design (OOD):  
  - Developed following C++ OOD principles for maintainability and scalability.  
  - Modular code structure promoting reusability and easy customization.  
- Game Over Condition:  
  - Player fails if the snake head collides with its own body.
